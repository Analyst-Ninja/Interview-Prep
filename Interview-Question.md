I use MySQL for simpler tasks like raw data storage and PostgreSQL for analytical workloads.

### How do you partition and parallelize data processing tasks in Apache Spark?
> **Answer:** I partition data based on natural keys or categorical attributes that distribute evenly across nodes, minimizing data skew. For example, in the Reddit Sentiment Analysis pipeline, I partitioned by subreddit to parallelize processing. I also leverage `repartition()` and `coalesce()` functions to adjust the number of partitions based on task needs.

### How do you handle scalability in distributed databases?
> **Answer:** I handle scalability by sharding data across different nodes and using replication for fault tolerance. For instance, in MySQL, I apply horizontal partitioning for large datasets. I also ensure that indexes are optimized to reduce query time as the data grows.

## Data Modeling & Analytics

### How do you approach data modeling for large-scale data systems?
> **Answer:** I follow a dimensional modeling approach for analytical systems, using star or snowflake schemas to optimize query performance. I carefully design fact and dimension tables based on business requirements. For instance, in the 'Customer Profiling – CC' project, I modeled data around credit card transactions using customer and transaction dimensions.

### Can you explain how you used K-means clustering with Spark MLlib for customer segmentation?
> **Answer:** I applied K-means clustering on 80 lakh credit card customers based on features like spending patterns, card type, and income levels. After training the model, we identified key segments such as high spenders or frequent travelers, which helped the bank prioritize customer service through IVR segmentation.

### How do you decide which machine learning algorithms to use in data processing pipelines?
> **Answer:** I decide based on the problem at hand. For clustering, K-means works well for customer segmentation. For regression tasks, Random Forest Regression was chosen for heat flow prediction due to its high accuracy and interpretability as it performed best based on R² and RMSE metrics.

### How do you ensure that your data models remain scalable and efficient as data grows?
> **Answer:** I implement partitioning and indexing strategies in my data models. I also periodically review and refactor queries for efficiency. Using distributed frameworks like Spark ensures that as data grows, computational resources are scaled horizontally, keeping performance optimal.

## DevOps & Infrastructure
